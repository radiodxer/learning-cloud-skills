# Introduction

This repository comprises some information how to start building basic cloud skills. 

This README.md file gathers pointers to other documentation found in this repository and also some instructions regarding in which order you should proceed if you are a complete cloud novice.

# Motivation

**NOTE**: The most important part of learning is will power! Don't get intimitated if you feel that learning cloud skills is difficult. It is not. Cloud skills is not rocket science, some of the skills are a bit hard to acquire, but it definitely is not rocket science. Start learning some small and build your competence gradually. Remember this old proverb: ["A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_journey_of_a_thousand_miles_begins_with_a_single_step).


# First Decision: Which Public Cloud Provider?

Your first decision is whether to start learning [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) or [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/). Browse those sites a bit and have a conversation with your colleagues and your line manager - where is the most demand among your customers at the moment? - that is a good piece of advice to base your decision on - customer need.


# Next Step: Cloud Account

So, you have decided which public cloud to start learning. Your next step is to **get a cloud account** - you cannot learn cloud skills just by reading books - you absolutely need a cloud account. Public clouds provide "free tier services" or a certain amount of free credits if you order a personal account. You should also ask your line manager if there already is a cloud account for learning purposes in your unit. If not, could it be possible to order one. Search in Tieto Intra how to order a cloud account for your unit.


# Start Learning Cloud Skills!

Ok, I assume now that you have decided which cloud provider to learn and you have an account for that cloud. Then: start learning!

These are the things you should learn first:

- Basic information regarding the **cloud and its basic services** (e.g. virtual network, basic storage options, basic computing options).
- How to use the cloud provider's **portal** efficiently.
- How to create **infrastructure as code**.

I recommend to order a [Pluralsight](https://learn.pluralsight.com/) account for learning in Tieto Shop. There are a lot of simple introduction type courses in Pluralsight just to learn those basic skills. While you are watching the courses, keep the cloud portal open and experiment with it. You also should try to create some cloud resources using the cloud's command line interface (CLI) and infrastructure code.

I'll provide more detailed instructions for various topics that you should learn next:

- [AWS Basics](aws-basics.md).
- [Azure Basics](aws-basics.md).
- [GCP Basics - TODO: later](gcp-basics.md).
- [Terraform Basics](terraform-basics.md).

Testing watch.
