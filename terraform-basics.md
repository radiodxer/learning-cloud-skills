# Introduction

This document gives basic instructions how to start building your infrastructure as code skills using Terraform. This is not a Terraform course - there are plenty of Terraform courses available in the net, I recommend you to google them e.g. "Terraform introduction". At least [Pluralsigh](www.pluralsight.com) provides various Terraform courses. 

# Terraform - How to Get Started?

First read some theory. Read [Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/). If you can get Pluralsight account watch the various Terraform related courses you can find there.

Next step is to use Terraform to create actual Infrastructure as Code (IaC). 

Get a good HCL / Terraform plugin for your editor - this way it is a lot easier to create infra code when your editor is context aware regarding HCL syntax and Terraform resources. 

I have also provided various Terraform intro demos for Tieto cloud learners:
- [AWS-intro-demo](https://github.com/tieto-pc/aws-intro-demo)
- [Azure-intro-demo](https://github.com/tieto-pc/azure-intro-demo)
- [GCP-intro-demo](https://github.com/tieto-pc/gcp-intro-demo)

There are also training videos in Tieto Learning as a Lifestyle platform in which I deploy these IaC demos. First watch the training video to get an understanding what is happening in the deployment process and to understand the IaC module structure. Then try to deploy the demo yourself. 

To become a good cloud developer follows the same path as to become a productive software developer - you have to create a lot of code to get practical experience, this time infrastructure as code.
