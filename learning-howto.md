# Introduction

This document gives basic instructions how to be an effective learner. So, this document does not talk about learning some specific skill (like cloud skills) but how to learn in general.

# A Brief Introduction to Learning

How to become a good specialist in any field? I think there are a few important characteristics, and those characteristics have little to do with natural talent and more with hard work. First you have to have **[inner motivation](https://medium.com/tieto-developers/inner-motivation-always-beats-outer-motivation-677e7962d958)** - be curious like a small child when he or she learns the wonders of the world. Think of new technology the same way like when you were a child with a bunch of mechano legos - what amazing things can I build with this stuff?

Then you have to have **will power**. You have to *decide* that you want to be a cloud guru one day. You don't become a cloud guru over night or after one course - this is a life-long journey. You need will power to stay focused in your new path.

I also have a Master's degree in Cognitive Psychology, so I know bits and pieces also about how to be an effective learner. One important thing in learning is **regularity**. You need to make learning a habit. Allocate some time for learning every day. Personally I find evenings as a creative time for myself (well, my children are already adults so I can spend my evenings pretty much the way I like - and I like learning). But even if you have a lot of family responsibilities (and family always goes first) try to find at least some 15 minutes for learning every day. Do it on a bus when traveling to work or on bed when children are sleeping. It doesn't matter when, but make it regular. Every day.

You also need a **study path** and some **goals** for your learning process. I hope the documents in this repository serve as a rudimentary study path, and also provide you some goals for your learning.
